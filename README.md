Workflow of DonorChoose.org in the USA.
Donor Choose is a Non profit organization in the USA, In which a teacher can submit a project proposal that needs funding.

A large No of volunteers working in the organization should manually screen the project proposal and decide the project needs to be approved or not based on the certain information provided by the Teacher for funding.

The project which gets approved by volunteers get posted in Donor website and the Donor can choose any one of the projects which is posted on website can like it or Donate some funding to it.

Problem we are trying to solve for Donor Choose Organizations?
DonorChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands project proposal each year or classroom projects in need of funding.

 Before posting the approved projects on DonorChoose.org website a large no of volunteers need to check each submission and decide for the approval. 

Next year DonorChoose.org excepts to receives 50,000 projects proposal.
The three main proposal they are trying to solve and we will be working.
  1, How to scale current manual process and quickly screen 50,000 
    projects so they can be posted as quickly and efficiently in 
    website.
 2, How to increase the consistency of projects vetting across 
     different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers.
 3, How to focus the volunteer time that needs more assistance.
     Here the donorchoose.org wants us partially automate the 
     process of manually screening so that approval can be done 
     faster and efficiently and volunteer can focus more on that need 
     assistance.

Our Goal here is we will try to solve all the problem of donorchoose.org is having by using Machine learning and the state of the art Natural Language processing Techniques, As we have Lot of text features to deal with.
